# Santosh Mood Sprites Needed

The following Santosh mood sprites are still needed to complete the character implementation:

## Required Files:
- `santosh-happy.png` (64x64px) - For positive events and success
- `santosh-sad.png` (64x64px) - For negative events and failures  
- `santosh-angry.png` (64x64px) - For trouble events and conflicts

## Usage Context:
- **Happy**: Brick making success, client deals, positive reputation gains
- **Sad**: Failed negotiations, lost workers, financial troubles
- **Angry**: Trouble events, machine breakdowns, market crashes

## Guidelines:
- Use pixel art style matching other characters
- Maintain consistent sizing (64x64px)
- Include transparency for better integration
- Follow Minecraft-inspired aesthetic
- Show clear emotional expressions

Once these are added, the game will automatically use the appropriate mood based on the event context.
